# CakePHP Kcaptcha Plugin #

This is a CakePHP plugin to use kcaptcha easily.

## Requirements

- PHP >= 5
- CakePHP >= 2.0

## Installation

In your Plugin directory,

	git clone git://github.com/stahoos/CakePHP-Kcaptcha-Plugin.git KCaptcha

Or in current directory of your repository,

	git submodule add git://github.com/stahoos/CakePHP-Kcaptcha-Plugin.git Plugin/KCaptcha

If you want to use your kcaptcha library(maybe for your config file), put the files into `vendor/kcaptcha`.
in folder `vendor/kcaptcha1` is old 1.2.6 version

## Usage

Setup Captcha component to your controller:


	<?php
	
	class PostsController extends AppController {
	
		public $components = array(
			'Kcaptcha.Captcha',
		);
	}


Use Captcha helper(automatically set by the component) in your form. For example:

	<?php
		echo $this->Form->create('Post');
		echo $this->Form->input('body');
		echo $this->Captcha->render();
		echo $this->Form->input('captcha');
		echo $this->Form->end('Submit');
	?>

Simply it's done! Your Post model will validate user's input for the captcha.

See following API reference for more options or any custom features.

### API reference

#### Captcha component

Component's settings are:

- `$sessionKey` - `string` session key for captcha. you should create the action for render if this was changed. default is `'Kcaptcha.answer'`.
- `$model` - `string` name of a model to validate. default is controller's `$modelClass`.
- `$setupHelper` - `boolean` whether the helper automatically added. default is `true`.
- `$autoSetAnswer` - `boolean` whether the answer automatically set to the model. default is `true`.

Component's methods:

- `render()` - to render the captcha. this will output header and body for captcha image.
- `clearSession()` - to clear the session data for answer of captcha. you don't need to call this but can use if you want to banish.

#### Captchable behavior

Behavior's settings are:

- `$answerProperty` - `string` the model property that the answer is automatically set on. default is `'captchaAnswer'`.
- `$field` - `string` the field to vlidate. default is `'captcha'`.
- `$rule` - `string` the rule set name to validate. default is `'captcha'`.
- `$convertKana` - `boolean` if `true`, multi-byte of user input will be converted to single-byte. default is `true`.
- `$trim` - `mixed` whether user input will be trimmed, otherwise regexp of spaces. default is regexp that multi-byte spaces(PCRE).
- `$required` - `boolean` whether the answer is required. you can also turn on or off with `requireCaptcha()`. default is `true`.
- `$setupValidation` - `boolean` whether basic validation set for captcha is automatically set to your model. default is `true`.

Behavior's methods:

- `setupCaptchaValidation()` - to set basic validation set. see `$setupValidation` property.
- `setCaptchaAnswer()` - to set the answer for captcha. used by Captcha component's `startup()`.
- `requireCaptcha($yes = boolean)` - determine whether answer is required.
- `validCaptcha($input)` - to validate the answer for captcha.

#### Captcha helper

There is only `render($url[optional])` method.

This will show this plugin's `Captcha` controller's `render_captcha` action with `<img>` tag by default.

You should specify the `$url` to your controller's action if you had to use `CaptchaComponent::render()` in the action.
